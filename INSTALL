Steps to install:
- copy the sdcard folder to the root of the sdcard and rename it to "OpenRecovery"
- copy the correct zip file (see phones) from the zip folder to the root of the sdcard
- on XT701, flash the lite version image (inside zips folder)
- on MILESTONE, flash the vulnerable recovery SBF file (inside zips folder)
- if you're using bootstrap version, see the INSTALL in bootstrap folder

Phones:
SHOLS is for Motorola Milestone (using vulnerable recovery)
STCU is for Motorola Sholes Tablet XT701

Phones using the bootstrap version:
SHOLS is for Motorola Milestone (only for development)
STR is for Motorola Milestone XT720

Automatic booting into Open Recovery on Motorola Milestone:
!!! THIS WILL PREVENT FROM AUTOMATIC APPLIANCE OF AN OTA UPDATE !!!
- ensure the script inside the zip folder is called on startup when booting normally (sh hijack, or inside mot_boot_mode)
- reboot into recovery and boot Open Recovery manually
- on next reboot into recovery, Open Recovery will be booted automatically
